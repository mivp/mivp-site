  the Data Cliff: Visualisation Strategies for Understanding Large Data</strong></p>\r\n<p>As
  scientific instrumentation is advanced, total data volumes increase in size, acquisition
  rate and complexity. Spectacular examples include the Large Hadron Collider projects,
  the Allen Human Brain Atlas, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope projects and closer

  informatics approaches are solving the challenges of storing, finding and retrieving
  large data extracts and collections, and instantiating sophisticated post-processing
  workflows.</p>\r\n<p class=\"vspace\">But what of traditional analysis and visualisation,
  and understanding and comprehending the data at hand? Drawing examples from neuroscience,
  astrophysics, geoscience and anatomy, I will describe the data that is collected
  and how it is analysed, and especially visualised, to enable discovery and insight.
  I will place this work in the context of the impending data cliff that many science
  and engineering disciplines face, and motivate the need for advanced, immersive
  visualisation facilities that are closely-coupled to the large data sources and
  computing systems.</p>\r\n<p class=\"vspace\">With the scene set, I will introduce
  Monash University's newest advanced visualisation platform, the CAVE2 (TM), built
  in collaboration with our partners at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at
  the University of Illinois at Chicago. CAVE2 is a large-scale, immersive, head-tracked
  virtual reality environment backed by a high-performance supercomputer. It boasts
  84 million pixels at ultra-high clarity and contrast, and exploits Monash's research-grade
  network fabric to connect to local and remote data sources and supercomputing centres.</p>\r\n<p
  class=\"vspace\">Monash foresees the CAVE2 becoming a critical piece of research
  infrastructure, fulfilling the role of the world's finest viewfinder in the 21st
  century microscope, but also serving a unique role as a collaborative display environment
  for comprehending large data, accelerating and transforming the research process
  to enable the most important discoveries now and in the future. I will describe
  and highlight our early successes in the CAVE2 and finally, briefly speculate on
  the future of immersive visualisation.</p>"
