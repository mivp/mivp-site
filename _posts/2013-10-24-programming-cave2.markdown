excerpt: "<p>During the current period, while the CAVE2 is being established as a
  Monash Technology Research Platform, we are not supporting end-user programming
  of the CAVE2. We expect to commence this support in early 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Users
  can prepare in advance by learning about the following software frameworks which
  form the 'middleware' of the Monash CAVE2:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.sagecommons.org/\"
  target=\"_blank\" title=\"Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE)\">Scalable
  Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE)</a> for large-screen, hybrid 2-d/3-d collaborative
  applications and meetings. SAGE comes configured with applications including image
  display (2-d and 3-d), movie playing (e.g. H.264 HD content), audio file playback
  and PDF document display. Additional applications we will be supporting in the near
  term (late 2013, early 2014) include desktop sharing. For programmers, SAGE provides
  the ability to stream pixels in from third-party programs running locally or remotely.</li>\r\n<li><a
