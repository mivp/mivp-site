&lt;p&gt;Astronomical images and datasets are increasingly high-resolution and multi-dimensional. The vast majority of astronomers perform all of their visualisation and analysis tasks on low-resolution, two-dimensional desktop monitors. If there were no technological barriers to designing the ultimate immersive stereoscopic display for astronomy, what would it look like? What capabilities would we require of our compute hardware to drive it? And are existing technologies even close to providing a true 3D experience that is compatible with the depth resolution of human stereoscopic vision? With the CAVE2 (an 80 Megapixel, hybrid 2D and 3D virtual reality environment directly integrated with a 100 Tflop/s GPU-powered supercomputer) and the Oculus Rift (a low-cost, head-mounted display) as examples at opposite financial ends of the immersive display spectrum, I will discuss the changing face of high-resolution, immersive visualisation for astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Barnes</name></author><category term="Talks and presentations" /><summary type="html">Rydges World Square Sydney Oral presentation - Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems XXV Christopher Fluke - 2015 October 28 The Ultimate Display Astronomical images and datasets are increasingly high-resolution and multi-dimensional.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stereoscopic Space Map – Semi-immersive Configuration of 3D-stereoscopic Tours in Multi-display Environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although large-scale stereoscopic 3D environments likeCAVEs are a favorable location for group presentations, the perspective projection and stereoscopic optimization usually follows a navigator-centric approach. Therefore, these presentations are usually accompanied by strong side-effects, such as motion sickness which is often caused by a disturbed stereoscopic vision. The reason is that the stereoscopic visualization is usually optimized for the only head-tracked person in the CAVE – the navigator – ignoring the needs of the real target group – the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To overcome this misconception, this work proposes an alternative to the head tracking-based stereoscopic effect optimization. By using an interactive virtual overview map in 3D, the pre-tour and on-tour configuration of the stereoscopic effect is provided, partly utilizing our previously published interactive projection plane approach. This Stereoscopic Space Map is visualized by the zSpace 200®, whereas the virtual world is shown on a panoramic 330° CAVE2TM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pilot expert study with eight participants was conducted using pre-configured tours through 3D models. The comparison of the manual and automatic stereoscopic adjustment showed that the proposed approach is an appropriate alternative to the nowadays commonly used head tracking-based stereoscopic adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Barnes</name></author><category term="Talks and presentations" /><summary type="html">Hilton San Francisco Union Square Hotel Oral presentation - Stereoscopic Displays and Applications XXVII Bjorn Sommer - 2016 February 15 Stereoscopic Space Map – Semi-immersive Configuration of 3D-stereoscopic Tours in Multi-display Environments Although large-scale stereoscopic 3D environments likeCAVEs are a favorable location for group presentations, the perspective projection and stereoscopic optimization usually follows a navigator-centric approach.
